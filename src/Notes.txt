Prioritization
********************************************************************************

Priority:             1 = ASAP        5 = Backlog     10 = Do later
T-Shirt Sizing:       S = Small       M = Medium      L = Large 

10-3: Mobile
1-M: "Archived" features list
         Description: (add "Settings" feature for which stats to be included for current user. Based on upload, if you use document list of switchs )
         Settings: can control archived features *which is a great idea
5-M: FIR L/F/R attribute should be stat displayed somethere
         Simliar to how individual holes show a stat for FIR L/F/R and scores for left miss vs right, show this is a flow state
         Get rid of sankey graph (not working) and create visual to illustrate hole
         Reference swing thoughts to book & copy phrases
5-S: Scorecard entry option to "Hide Round" or "Just for fun round" with dropdown of notes to be added to rounds (example: boozeRound)
5-M: Custom filter option to add course - popup to select course from dropdown with search ability?
5-S: Custom filter for last 20 rounds (will display only last 20 in activeRounds sorted by date, should also work in tandem with other filters)
5-L: Calculate approach metrics for Par 4 and Par 5 separately - based on DTG. Will paint better picture of actual GIR and G-1 probably from 250+  
7-L: Add form for new course data (Course name, can dynamically create course key, HDCP, Distance) - ability to pull in existing course data
10-M: Ability to edit existing scorecards and update in DB
5-M: Custom filters for ANY round attribute (call it advanced filter?) - will likely just need to create modal for each value, display names for each attribute,
          Will need to filter out some attributes (course key, maybe other duplicates such as Date which already exists in GolfTable headers)
          Allows sort Ascending/Descending for certain attributes (not course)
          Allow applying of secondary filter (After filtering by A, filter by B)?
5-L: Allow partial rounds to be added
8-S: Make course records sortable by date (need to add) & total score to par
7-S: DONE: Add country flag beside international round course names (configure image source in consts)
7-M: Pull PGA tour data (ex driving distance) for comparisons -> find .chakra-table tr that contains td->span text "tour average", scan all other spans and output value that is number




First tourney is FREE, $25 payout to winner - make live by Mar 6 (Puerto Rico open), week before PLAYERS

Entire site feature: golf pools
make gmail for "Gilson Golf Pools"
Google form for player selection -> able to multiselect 6 players (not tiered? or use dfs salaries?)
          could also be form on site
     -pull all players from "tournaments" api
Send form results via email before tournament start with link to leaderboard (send 1 hour before tourney)
     -create email list with "unsubscribe" button?
Payment management (venmo or apple pay only) - google docs column (also linked to email)
Create tournament schema
     -date
     -tourney name
     -leaderboard link (pga tour site)

Pull entire leaderboard


keep running list of everyone's results (by email)
     -number of tournmanets played
     -players selected with results (scoreToPar, birdies, 1/2/3 place)
     -average payout (Expected Value - EV per tournament)






scorecards api returns massive array of all golfers
https://rapidapi.com/slashgolf/api/live-golf-data/playground/apiendpoint_7f2f7f19-0407-4724-a1e5-abffc7c4a299


Establish a list of features from above and compile with list from phone to determine which is the best one to get ready for next GHIN season

when working offline, allow rounds to be entered on UI and populated into temporary file
- when back online, attempt to insert round information from file and delete

For scorecard entry, make overlay of golf hole disgram made with this tool
https://www.reddit.com/r/Inkscape/comments/zavhkw/how_to_make_a_quick_editable_map_of_a_golf_hole/


10/15/24 SS Hole 13 should have 3P, not LB for notes

!displayUploadButton && activePage !== "Enter Scorecard" && activePage !== "Course Tour"


Rename eagleRound to highlightRound - need to calculate "eagleRound" along with other round metrics seen in mongo
Similar to rounds being highlighted, highlight nice course names with font color? (TPC logo beside course name?) (destination round icon - make tooltip hover) (bucketlist round icon - make tooltip hover)

Find all instances of array of 2 Blackledge courses and make into CONST file

Features:
Avg DTG/FPM/DTM
Scramble shots off tee/putt/approach
Include additional holes in single hole metrics
Percent of Sand shots still in sand & sand shots DTH/DTG

**Map of all courses played with coordinates
legacy scorecards


Store "notable" legacy rounds to filter

Clickable course info by golf table


Handicap variance after each round 0.2->0.4->+0.1 - will be more strict about entering scores each time (more accurate and accountability to only post good scores)


******** Set up feature for FIR to take in L12, as in a number will indicate how many yards off the fair are you. Can begin next GHIN season (March 15th)



Golf book notes
         

ADD COMPONENTS - YOU NEED TO MODULARIZE YOUR CODE

Build container functions similar to global.css (most similar to )

Index of all features in the app


Go through all images on phone


Need to work on Par 3 scoring average is at 3.26 - could this be a part of "works in progress?"





Need to publish this site
Need to connect to mongo and not have to use Excel - migrate all legacy data, can probably translate with a Anaconda PY code editing tool (could be on other laptop)



Add environment variable (DEV_MODE=true, default to false when not being passed, in case of deploy)
Controls display of new page: "advanced settings" containing Feature Index (defined above)
         This can just be a card coded HTML page (should be it's own component)
         Break these notes into tabs - these will be for each site (below .ENV variable): Golf, Coins
Environment variable will be a few options "World of Jack" (Taylor came up with this name), "Gilson Golfs", "Coins" ----- need to add coin page
         Has helped me find purpose, can reflect on the best things in life (part of vows?) Need to illustrate how beautiful life is and website is the vehicle to reflection and self fulfillment for me
All code can still live in one codebase but published as different sites
ENV will control which actions are visible in advanced settings
Default site "configuration" (now being called settings) may be starting initial state for settings page toggles/archived features


* Before reading below - make more sense to break these into different apps? One for golf and one for world of jack - these two sites should link back and fourth (On golf site, Created by "World of Jack")
         Link to LinkedIN porfile? or share a post with network? "It's not a portfolio site, but you get an idea of my abilities."
         
Make Coins page - Before documenting coins, create WF's for UI page

Make Finances page - similar to "displayed rounds", have page to illustrate expense in each category, graphs for growth of each fund
             Money timeline? Robinhood (deposited $3k Aug 2024)
             Instead of conditional formatting, color code a pie chart with assets in each category
Pie chart for Budgeting each year
Have sliders to make budget dynamic
Fun category
     + Add Expense button to pie chart

Wish list page with sliders
     If 10% of budget should go towards
     Add links to items on amazon (embed listings <iframe/> into page?)
     Housing decorations budget:
             $500 or X per year
             New chairs, items are "weighted" based on tandem of rating factors:
                 *Sorted by price
                 "Want vs need" factor, 1 = want, 10 = need
                 "Turndogs" or "Zoomies" rating, based on how important it is to you (Tooltip note: "Note: this rating is sacred, and must be weighted conservatively. Use caution, and pick your battles")

      Implementation detail: Supply a list of links (copied from prime)
      Add prompt for wishlist items that have not entered "rating factor"
             This gets saved locally, if this item does not have "rating factors" saved, it automatically asks users to enter a few questions (above)
             

Coding block example to control budget initial values

(These values could derive from mongo as a user profile data point), populated on UI and published to DB with edits
CONSTS for now, convert to ***Finances DB***
Annual Financial Summary entries (Can be it's own tab - make visible for each year instead of just all on one sheet)

year *primary key
finances CONSTS: 
     ATTRIBUTES = {
         keyName: "k401",
         displayName: "401(k)"
     }

income = X
deductions = 10%
401(k) Contribution = 10%
taxed = 24%

**Feature note: Before converting to DB, need to make every column number instead of currency format
Assets: {
     k401: "100000"
     robinhood: "10000"
}

Ability to compare ach year and see which assets grew the most in a year
"Annual review section for each year"
Ability to compare 2 years side by side
In WF, ensure all components can be segregated in to L/R halves of screen

Finance sections on page: annual summaries row (similar to golf) Saved X number of dollars
     Row expansion subcomponent (or individual year tab) can display the following features:
             Bar graph (experiment timeline component) with toggle for "current savings" and "cumulative savings" (all time)



Features need a notes section to describe all code

Should probably document every function in this site



Photo album for life events on site? Can begin documenting and organzing papers for football games, wedding invites, sorted by date

Wedding page - should publish this


Allow handicap calcluation to take *course rating* into account

Don't need to migrate to mongo just yet, prioritize late and continue to use Excel upload for the time being



*****Try to post this year as post of blog - add day/month/year to each item posted, including swing videos/swing thought journal entries/youtube content ****
section to post youtube videos/screen recordings/my swing videos of each shot type/other content






Modularize codebase better, move functions and helpers into different files

Begin using consts more



Feature Ideas
Scorecard Data "Key"
     -Scorecard needs to be it's own component
     -In scorecard, beside "Expand" link, show toggle for expansion (stop using) expand collapse verbiage (might not have to be it's own component yet, could just display toggle with onclick?)
     -Toggle named "Show Key": scorecard details and course info
     -Can show FIR = Fairway in Regulation
     -Style: Small font, add beside chips shown for each score (Eagle = yellow, etc.)
     -While editing this feature, edit scoring background color key to background color behind score Name <Badge title="Eagle" backgroundColorYellow />
     -Style: display all keys in a flex flow row wrap space between container




Maybe not needed - search "handicapCutoffRoundBottomBorder"
Small style: handicap 20 round subsomponent?
----- better divider to show "Handicap" Cutoff similar to the appearance of this row with divider? (Could make use of CSS :after if needed) ------
.map(rounds => (need to take index parameter "i" to show small divider subcomponent to show HDCP cutoff indication, which only shows when sorted by date) => ( return ) ) function that is used to display 


Chips/Badge beside each round
     Passed into mongo entry 
     For now split/regex on date cell
     CONDITIONS=[Rainy, ...
     More scorecard fields when entering on site and connected to Mongo: Who did you play with?
                 Entering name will begin to populate people you have already played with
                 Can view stat to see how well you play with each person
         Can find if there are other data points to add here
         
     Populate chip if certain conditions are true
         "Story" round - something interesting happened
         Eagle round/even par or better round - remove row indication?
         Migrate "HDCP" tag/badge in place of current indication

     
         

     Prepopulate a few "sample conditions" (or just call them "Round tags")
         Separate alllllll options for tags into sections:
                 Weather
                 Playing 
     (with feature to add conditions to each round) in excel cell row) course conditions) rain, 



Annual summary needs CONSTS file
     Each year, enter low HDCP number (2024: 0.2)
     Populate column for low GHIN and make this sortable by year (disokay new column when filter for annual summaries is shown)




"timeline" component for different section of site
https://mui.com/material-ui/react-timeline/



Post site on reddit
putting revelation - Highlight that putter alignment was off? Take picture? seems to be fine, just has to do with grip/forward press positioning
Link to previous post
Footage of stroke from different angles?


Github Submodules for WorldOfJack fragments - could be separate frontends with different styles


Golf Expenses spreadsheet or table? add "category" for club/round/punch pass/range pass/range balls - ability to add more categories on UI



Annual summary to include swing videos of each shot type?
     Shot types: putter, driver, PW, 7i, 2i, 4W
     Chips: flop, chip (stock), pitch (low), BR
     Show visualization of shot shape



Diagram of swing videos with shot shapes
     Left of screen shows different shot shapes
         Default left side to "stock" swing on right of screen
         Swing thoughts - should this derive "WIP" from swing notes - currently contained in to notes on phone but could be updated on site
         Inspiration section is optional - could be self taught, from book, video
     When one is clicked, updates right of screen to show the associated video
     Timestamp a date to each swing video (Last Updated: Nov. 2024)
     Footage of stroke from different angles?


Document ALL swing reps in excel somewhere - ideally in site
     Ability to enter practice routine, number of shots, date, swing thoughts
     Can overlap with trends (Show beside rounds) in scoring eventually


Future: integrate with AI to ask what I should be working on given 10GIR 8FIR each round, what should I work on
     Autogenerate pre-defined template prompt to be copied - query an AI directly?


         
Questionairre of things end of each year

Golf - specific part: "How did you do this year, what did you work on, what was the best swing thought/insp item from this year, what can be improved, goals for next year"



Hide mongo uri in ENV's

Hied scorecard entry tab - any other tabs to be hidden?


Latest NPM version - should get latest Node version too
https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm

 

Compile all notes into this file going forward.









Pool notes

Stableford
could get scorecard data ONLY for selected golfers, for all others, "no one has selected this player"
Calculate at end of each day? Not good for following live leaderboard - would cost a LOT to upgrade
    For each player, would need to pull 4 times per day (16 per tournament)
        Could display leaderboard and calculate stableford at end of day 
            Would still require pull for every player

Link to monitor Rapid API requests (60 starting 1/14/2025)
https://rapidapi.com/developer/analytics/default-application_10075500



After tournament wraps, could begin savings player scoring averages
    Could fetch some legacy rounds if I still have fetches left for month
        1 needed for year schedule, 2 more for each tournament to pull tournamentData and leaderboardData
    "Cut % made since X data" (5/6)
    EV = salary / strokes under par (can't use old DFS salaries for these calulations)
        Is there strenth of schedule


Could beginmaking "predictive analysis" with ability to assign weight to various metrics (maybe using data golf)
    10% of "score" is previous 3 tournament results
    10% previous results at same tournament
    10% driving distance (weighted based on tournament)
    10% FPM putting
    etc.
